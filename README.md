# UnitConverter
Just a small project to work on while I learn some GTK stuff

Currently this is only GTK+ 2 but once I get all the functionality that I want this to have, I'll work on porting it over to
GKT+3

I'm not the most experienced with C. If there are any erros (memory leaks that I didn't fix, bad programming style/habit, an easier way for me to do something)
don't hesistate to tell me. I want to fix it and learn.
