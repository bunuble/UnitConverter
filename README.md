# Unit Converter
Just a small project to work on while I learn some GTK stuff. I decided to do this project because my only GUI experience
was Swing and JavaFX. I used the website https://better-dpt-roll.github.io/ to choose a random project for me.

I'm not the most experienced with C. If there are any errors (memory leaks that I didn't fix, bad programming style/habit, an easier way for me to do something,typos, etc)
don't hesistate to tell me. I want to fix it and learn.

I got the basics of what I wanted to be done completed. Adding more units is just adding more to the combobox and adding more if statements. I am going to stop working on this now and move on to other small projects with other GUI frameworks. I might go back and fix some bugs and optimize it more but it won't be top priority.

+ TO DO:
  * ~~Add in other units.~~ (Only added one more set but more can easily be added)
  * Maybe find a better way to convert between units other than a bunch of if statements. (Please tell me if you can think of a way)
  * ~~Add a "unit selector" (so you can choose between mass, temp, etc) and the two drop down menus will change accordingly~~
  * ~~Make it work both ways (enter number into right side and it'll change left side and vice versa).~~
+ BUGS:
  * If you delete everything in the text field and then start putting numbers in, it won't convert right away and you need to add in more numbers. A way to bypass this is to add more numbers until it starts converting and then you can delete some until you get back to the number that you wanted.
  * Probably lots more that I didn't notice or find. If you find any, don't hesitate to let me know!
