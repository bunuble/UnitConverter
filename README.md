# Unit Converter
Just a small project to work on while I learn some GTK stuff. I decided to do this project because my only GUI experience
was Swing and JavaFX. I used the website https://better-dpt-roll.github.io/ to choose a random project for me.

Currently this is only GTK+ 2 but once I get all the functionality that I want this to have, I'll work on porting it over to
GKT+3

I'm not the most experienced with C. If there are any errors (memory leaks that I didn't fix, bad programming style/habit, an easier way for me to do something,typos, etc)
don't hesistate to tell me. I want to fix it and learn.

As of Jun 1, 2016, lb -> kgs and vice versa works but I'll be adding in new units

+ TO DO:
  * Add in other units.
  * Maybe find a better way to convert between units other than a bunch of if statements.
  * ~~Add a "unit selector" (so you can choose between mass, temp, etc) and the two drop down menus will change accordingly~~ (After completing it, I realized I did it in the most ineffecient way and I could have just changed the titles. I will change this)
  * ~~Make it work both ways (enter number into right side and it'll change left side and vice versa).~~
